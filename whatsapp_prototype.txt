STEP 0 – What you need (before touching code)

Make sure you have:

Your phone

WhatsApp installed & logged in.

Stable internet.

Your laptop / PC

Windows (you already are).

Google Chrome installed.

Python 3.10+ installed (python --version).

Important note (official vs unofficial)

We’ll use WhatsApp Web automation (pywhatkit) for a free prototype.

It uses your personal WhatsApp via web.whatsapp.com.

It’s great for learning & internal use, but not an official production solution.

STEP 1 – Create a clean project + virtual environment

 venv. Let’s make a fresh one.

In Command Prompt / PowerShell:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

STEP 2 – Install the required Python packages

Still inside the venv:

pip install pywhatkit schedule pandas


pywhatkit → sends WhatsApp messages via WhatsApp Web.

schedule → run reminder jobs at specific times.

pandas → simple way to read client/case list from a file.

STEP 3 – Prepare client & case data

For the prototype, let’s keep it very simple: a CSV file.

Create a file called cases.csv inside hearing_whatsapp_bot with content like:

client_name,phone,case_id,hearing_date,hearing_time
Bharath,+918143755467,12345,2025-12-20,10:30
Lokesh,+919640733498,98765,2025-12-21,11:00
Rajendra,+917506030264,24680,2025-12-21,14:00


phone must be in international format: +91... etc.

hearing_date in YYYY-MM-DD.

hearing_time in HH:MM 24-hour.

For now, we’ll send “tomorrow’s hearing” reminders once every morning.
STEP 4 – Create a simple reminder script

Create a file send_reminders.py with this code:

import pandas as pd
import pywhatkit
import datetime as dt
import time
import schedule

CASES_FILE = "cases.csv"
INDIAN_TZ_OFFSET = 5.5  # if needed later

def load_cases():
    df = pd.read_csv(CASES_FILE)
    # ensure date/time columns are strings
    df["hearing_date"] = df["hearing_date"].astype(str)
    df["hearing_time"] = df["hearing_time"].astype(str)
    return df

def send_whatsapp_message(phone: str, message: str):
    print(f"Sending to {phone}: {message}")
    # instantly sends via web.whatsapp.com (must be logged in)
    pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg_instantly(
        phone_no=phone,
        message=message,
        wait_time=20,   # seconds to wait while opening WhatsApp Web
        tab_close=True,
        close_time=3
    )
    # small sleep to avoid spamming too fast
    time.sleep(5)

def send_tomorrow_reminders():
    today = dt.date.today()
    tomorrow = today + dt.timedelta(days=1)
    tomorrow_str = tomorrow.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

    df = load_cases()
    # filter cases with hearing_date == tomorrow
    upcoming = df[df["hearing_date"] == tomorrow_str]

    if upcoming.empty:
        print("No hearings tomorrow.")
        return

    for _, row in upcoming.iterrows():
        client = row["client_name"]
        phone = row["phone"]
        case_id = row["case_id"]
        hearing_date = row["hearing_date"]
        hearing_time = row["hearing_time"]

        msg = (
            f"Dear {client},\n"
            f"Reminder: Your next hearing for Case {case_id} is scheduled on "
            f"{hearing_date} at {hearing_time}.\n\n"
            f"- Advocate Office"
        )

        send_whatsapp_message(phone, msg)

def main():
    # schedule the job every day at 09:00
    schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(send_tomorrow_reminders)

    print("Scheduler started. Waiting for next run...")
    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

STEP 5 – First manual test (without schedule)

Before relying on scheduler, let’s just call it once.

Temporarily change the bottom to:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_tomorrow_reminders()


Then run:

(venv) C:\Users\vgabbita\hearing_whatsapp_bot>python send_reminders.py


What will happen:

Chrome will open web.whatsapp.com.

First time: it will ask you to scan QR code using your mobile WhatsApp.

Open WhatsApp on phone → Linked devices → Link a device → scan.

After logged in, pywhatkit will:

Open chat with each phone in the CSV.

Type the message.

Send it automatically.

If messages arrive to those numbers → ✅ basic reminder sender is working.

STEP 6 – Re-enable scheduler

Change back to:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


Now, when you run:

python send_reminders.py


The script will keep running.

Every day at 09:00 (your system time), it will:

Read cases.csv

Find hearings scheduled for tomorrow

Send reminders.

Make sure your laptop + internet + Chrome stay on around the scheduled time.

What we’ll do next (once this is working)

Improve reminders:

2 days before + 1 day before + same-day alerts.

Move from CSV → SQLite DB for more structure.

Add “interactive bot” so clients can ask:

“What is my next hearing?”

“Case 12345 status?”
→ For that, we’ll likely use Selenium to read incoming messages from WhatsApp Web and reply automatically.

If you want, in the next step I can:

Convert this CSV logic into SQLite (more robust), and/or

Start designing the “client asks bot for next hearing” flow.

For now, try:

Creating the hearing_whatsapp_bot folder

Setting up venv + packages

Creating cases.csv

Running send_reminders.py once

…and tell me what happens (any error or success message).
======================================**************************=========================================
Perfect — now that sending reminders works, let’s continue building the complete WhatsApp-based hearing reminder + query system.

We'll do this step by step and keep everything in Python.

✅ NEXT STEPS ROADMAP

We will implement the following in order:

STEP 1 → Move from CSV → SQLite Database (robust, structured)

We will create:

A cases.db file

A cases table storing all client & case details

Functions to insert/update hearing dates

Queries to fetch next hearing for a client

STEP 2 → Improve Reminder Logic

We will send reminders:

2 days before the hearing

1 day before the hearing

On the hearing day (morning)

The bot will automatically filter upcoming hearings and send messages.

STEP 3 → Build the Interactive WhatsApp Bot (2-way)

Clients can message your WhatsApp number:

next hearing?
case 12345?


Bot replies with:

Your next hearing for Case 12345 is on 2025-12-17 at 10:30 AM.


We will use Selenium (free) to read incoming messages from WhatsApp Web, then automatically reply.

STEP 4 → Optional AI Components

Extract hearing dates from PDF orders

Convert unstructured text → hearing details

Maintain full case history per client

(We’ll add this later if you want.)

🔥 OK — Let’s start implementing STEP 1
✔ Convert CSV → SQLite Database
1️⃣ Create SQLite database file

Inside your project folder (Year_2026):

Create a new file:

db_setup.py

Add this code:

import sqlite3

def create_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect("cases.db")
    cur = conn.cursor()

    cur.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS cases (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        client_name TEXT NOT NULL,
        phone TEXT NOT NULL,
        case_id TEXT NOT NULL,
        hearing_date TEXT NOT NULL,
        hearing_time TEXT NOT NULL
    )
    """)

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    print("Database and table created successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_db()


Run it:

python db_setup.py


This creates:

cases.db


with a structured table.

✔ STEP 1.2 — Load your CSV data into SQLite (one-time)

Create new file:

import_from_csv.py

import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

CSV_FILE = "cases.csv"
DB_FILE = "cases.db"

def import_data():
    df = pd.read_csv(CSV_FILE)

    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
    cur = conn.cursor()

    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        client = row["client_name"]
        phone = str(row["phone"])
        if not phone.startswith("+"):
            phone = "+" + phone

        case_id = row["case_id"]
        hearing_date = str(row["hearing_date"])
        hearing_time = str(row["hearing_time"])

        cur.execute("""
        INSERT INTO cases (client_name, phone, case_id, hearing_date, hearing_time)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
        """, (client, phone, case_id, hearing_date, hearing_time))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    print("CSV data imported into SQLite successfully.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import_data()


Run:

python import_from_csv.py


You now have all data inside SQLite.

🎯 STEP 2 — Improved Reminder Logic (2-days-before + 1-day-before + same-day)

Replace your send_tomorrow_reminders() with this:

def send_all_reminders():
    today = dt.date.today()

    conn = sqlite3.connect("cases.db")
    cur = conn.cursor()

    # fetch all cases
    cur.execute("SELECT client_name, phone, case_id, hearing_date, hearing_time FROM cases")
    rows = cur.fetchall()

    for client, phone, case_id, hearing_date, hearing_time in rows:

        hearing_dt = dt.datetime.strptime(hearing_date, "%Y-%m-%d").date()

        delta = (hearing_dt - today).days

        # 2-days-before
        if delta == 2:
            msg = f"Reminder: Your hearing for Case {case_id} is in 2 days."
            send_whatsapp_message(phone, msg)

        # 1-day-before
        elif delta == 1:
            msg = f"Reminder: Your hearing for Case {case_id} is tomorrow at {hearing_time}."
            send_whatsapp_message(phone, msg)

        # same-day
        elif delta == 0:
            msg = f"Today is your hearing for Case {case_id} at {hearing_time}."
            send_whatsapp_message(phone, msg)

    conn.close()


Schedule it daily at 9 AM:

schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(send_all_reminders)

🚀 STEP 3 — Build the WhatsApp “Interactive Bot” (Selenium)

This allows clients to ASK:

✔ “Next hearing?”
✔ “Case 12345?”
✔ “My case status?”

And bot replies automatically.

⭐ We'll use Selenium (free, works with personal WhatsApp)

It will:

Monitor WhatsApp Web

Read incoming messages

Parse text

Query SQLite DB

Respond instantly

✔ Example: interactive_bot.py

I will generate the full code in the next step once you confirm steps 1 & 2 are working.

👉 Your Current Task

Before moving ahead:

✅ Please confirm:

Did SQLite database creation run successfully?

Did you import CSV data into SQLite without errors?

Do you want to begin implementing the Selenium-based interactive bot next?

Once you say YES, I will give you:

⭐ Full working WhatsApp INTERACTIVE BOT:

Reads messages

Recognizes “next hearing”

Recognizes “case 12345”

Replies with correct details

Logs interactions

Works entirely on your local machine

Just confirm and we continue!

========================**************************=========================================
STEP 3 — Build the INTERACTIVE WhatsApp BOT (Python + Selenium)

This bot will allow your clients to send messages like:

next hearing?
case 12345
my hearing date?
status 98765


And the bot automatically replies by reading the SQLite DB.

This is the most powerful part of the system.

✅ Overview of What We Will Build Now

Selenium opens WhatsApp Web

Bot monitors incoming chat messages

Bot extracts text sent by the user

Bot checks SQLite database

Bot replies to the user

Bot stays running and keeps listening

All this runs 100% locally on your laptop using your own WhatsApp account.

🔧 STEP 3.1 — Install Selenium & WebDriver Manager

Inside your virtual environment:

pip install selenium webdriver-manager


This avoids manual ChromeDriver installation (excellent for Windows).

🔧 STEP 3.2 — Create the Interactive Bot File

Create a file:

interactive_bot.py

Paste this full code:

import time
import sqlite3
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

DB_FILE = "cases.db"

# --- DB Function ---
def search_case(query_text):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
    cur = conn.cursor()

    # if user types: case 12345
    if "case" in query_text:
        parts = query_text.split()
        case_id = None
        for p in parts:
            if p.isdigit():
                case_id = p
                break

        if case_id:
            cur.execute("SELECT client_name, hearing_date, hearing_time FROM cases WHERE case_id=?", (case_id,))
            row = cur.fetchone()
            conn.close()

            if row:
                name, date, time_ = row
                return f"Case {case_id}:\nClient: {name}\nNext hearing: {date} at {time_}"
            else:
                return "Case not found."

    # if user types: next hearing
    if "next hearing" in query_text:
        cur.execute("SELECT client_name, case_id, hearing_date, hearing_time FROM cases ORDER BY hearing_date LIMIT 1")
        row = cur.fetchone()
        conn.close()

        if row:
            name, case_id, date, time_ = row
            return f"Next hearing is:\nCase {case_id}\nClient: {name}\nDate: {date} at {time_}"
        else:
            return "No upcoming hearings."

    conn.close()
    return "I didn't understand. Try: 'case 12345' or 'next hearing'."


# --- WhatsApp Bot Function ---
def start_whatsapp_bot():

    print("Starting WhatsApp bot...")

    # Launch Chrome with driver manager
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

    # Open WhatsApp Web
    driver.get("https://web.whatsapp.com")
    print("Please scan the QR code on WhatsApp Web.")
    time.sleep(15)

    print("Bot is now listening for messages...")

    last_text = ""

    while True:
        time.sleep(2)

        try:
            # Find all received messages (in the last chat)
            messages = driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, "//div[contains(@class,'message-in')]//div[contains(@class,'copyable-text')]")

            if not messages:
                continue

            latest_msg = messages[-1]
            msg_text = latest_msg.text.strip()

            if msg_text == last_text:
                continue  # ignore duplicates

            print("New message received:", msg_text)
            last_text = msg_text

            # Process message
            reply = search_case(msg_text.lower())

            # Message box
            input_box = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@title='Type a message']")
            input_box.click()
            time.sleep(1)
            input_box.send_keys(reply)
            time.sleep(1)

            # Send button
            send_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//span[@data-icon='send']")
            send_button.click()

            print("Replied:", reply)

        except Exception as e:
            print("Error:", e)
            continue


if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_whatsapp_bot()

🟢 STEP 3.3 — Run the bot

Activate venv:

.\venv\Scripts\activate


Run:

python interactive_bot.py


You should see:

Starting WhatsApp bot...
Please scan the QR code on WhatsApp Web.
Bot is now listening for messages...


Now:

👉 Scan the QR code
👉 Bot is ready

🧪 TESTING THE INTERACTIVE BOT

From another phone, send a message to your WhatsApp:

case 12345


Bot should reply with:

Case 12345:
Client: Bharath
Next hearing: 2025-12-17 at 09:00


Next test:

next hearing


Bot should reply with the closest hearing from the DB.
